        <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
        <p>In an abandoned Earth, Wall-E, Waste Allocation Load-Lifter: Earth-Class, is the only robot alive cleaning up the trash left behind, on the next day he encounters a rocket ship, which transported another robot called EVE to investigate any thing that's alive. Wall-E accidently watched her and they greet each other. He takes her to his place to show her the plant he found; unfortunately, that's what she was looking and it shuts her into self containment mode with the plant inside. Another rocket ship comes back to return her to the Axiom, a huge ship where living humans were just blobs with small bones. Wall-E grabs on to the ship's bars and gets sent into space. They soon enter the Axiom where the other robots take EVE to the cockpit. Wall-E follows EVE after she found out the plant was gone. Assuming that it was just a fault, the Captain thinks she was broken and decides to take them to diagnostics. Wall-E thought EVE was being taken apart so he tried to get her out until he shot her arm gun to the control panel, which opened all the broken robots' rooms into thinking he was a hero. They get caught by the robot guards and they assumed Wall-E and EVE were rouge robots. EVE decided to take Wall-E back to Earth since he caused too much chaos until they saw that one of the Captain's assistants has the plant from EVE and was taking it back. Wall-E took the plant back to EVE but the door shut on him and the pod blast off, shooting Wall-E deep into space. He escaped the pod and they went back to give the Captain the plant but EVE doesn't want Wall-E to cause more trouble so she left him in a hidden area where he wouldn't get caught. She gave the Captain the plant until his other assistant, AUTO told him that they can't return to Earth because of the pollution and radiation. The Captain didn't care so AUTO snatched the plant and tossed it into the garbage bin, but Wall-E caught it and kept it safe, then AUTO shocked him back down the bin. EVE was shut down and also went into the bin. They were going to be shot into outer space until MO: Microbe Obliterator found Wall-E and saved them both. They tried once more to get the plant to the cockpit with the help of the broken robots while the captain was fighting AUTO to open the Holo-Detector. Wall-E and EVE get there until the whole Axiom tilts sideways, leading them to drop the plant on the ground. Wall-E struggles to put the plant in the capsule until AUTO smashes on the button to close it, which crushes Wall-E. While Wall-E is damaged, the Captain reroutes AUTO's control and changes him to manual, and EVE put the plant in the capsule, setting the Axiom back to Earth in hyperdrive. EVE instantly takes Wall-E back to his base to fix him up; that however, had Wall-E's memory erased and he doesn't know anything about EVE. Now heartbroken, EVE took him close to her head and then an electrical shock happened which got Wall-E's memory back. Now the humans and robots are starting to fix Earth and put it back in its original state.</p>
